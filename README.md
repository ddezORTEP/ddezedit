# versions
there exist multiple versions of this program. These include : 
- version with vi-like commands (linux only)
- version with normal movement and commands (linux and windows)
# compiling
This editor can be compiled with the following commands. Firstly, clone into the repository using : 
``git clone https://github.com/ddezORTEP/ddezedit ``
Then, you can compile the source code using gcc : 
`` g++ pbedit-<version>.cpp -o pbedit -lncurses``
The same command can be using on windows using MinGW
# future version
I do not plan on updating this project. I don't recommend you use this as your text editor either (unless you use nano, in which case be my guest).
